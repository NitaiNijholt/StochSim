## Assignment 3

# Abstract

The use of simulated annealing (SA) has proven effective in finding global energy minima
in various problems across domains. This paper uses SA to minimise the total energy
state of multi-particle system constrained to a circle and finds accuracy is comparable to
physically based model alternatives. Certain properties found in the literature such as phase
transitions of the particle system when the number of particles increases were replicated, although
ending configurations proved less accurate compared to the force based alternative.
Experiments on parameter effects on SA convergence were conducted, with results indicating
that cooling schedules and Markov chain length significantly influence convergence performance,
while chain sorting mode did not. A Markov chain length equal to the number of
particles and logarithmic cooling were found to perform best. Results indicate that a carefully
balanced combination of problem representation and parameter settings is needed to
tune SA to achieve success.
