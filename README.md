## Assignment 1

Accurate area estimation of complex shapes is an ongoing challenge in science and engineering which numerical methods have been proven particularly suited for. However depending on the required accuracy level, computational costs can increase rapidly towards the infeasible. With the goal of finding estimation methods which reduce this computational costs without losing accuracy, this report compares the performance of different methods in estimating the area of the infinitely complex Mandelbrot set. The methods compared are random Monte Carlo sampling, Latin Hypercube Sampling, Orthogonal Sampling, and a new approach the authors propose: Adaptive Grid Rank sampling. Results conclusively show a significant reduction in variance with the introduction of stratification.
